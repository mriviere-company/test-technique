# test-technique

1. FizzBuzz++ :

To execute the test please enter "php -f FizzBuzz++.php yourdigit" in the terminal" like "php -f FizzBuzz++.php 689".

2. Test Javascript :

Go to folder test-javascript 'cd test-javascript' and put in terminal 'yarn start' or 'npm start'. It will open the page.

3. Data Parser :

To convert your file in CSV please enter "php -f parser.php yourdirectory" in the terminal" like "php -f parser.php parser_test".



Note :
Test Javascript isn't finish. It will display an error about the render but you can look at the react code.
And the for the Data Parser I ran out time so there is the way to get the files and to create a CSV but there isn't something for feed the CSV.
